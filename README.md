## Code Structure/Folder layout

## Code Outline 

### Part I: Memory Managment - Paging

### Part II: File System

## Getting Started/Build Instructions/Compilation/Running
The following contains the build instructions stating how to compile the code on a Linux OS for both our Java and C programs. It also contains Run instructions stating how to execute the compiled code on Linux for both Java and C program implementations.

### Build, Compilation, and Run Part I
The Java program has already been compiled with javac *.java inside the project folder of Part1-Java. To run the program you need to be outside the project folder in the src folder and run the command “java project.Run” to start the program where you will then be prompted for your information. 


### Build, Compilation, and Run Part 2
The C program has already been compiled and is part of the GitHub repository under Part2-C of the folder tree. However if you want to compile and run  the program yourself you can navigate to the file and within that section of the folder tree run the following:

* [Linux - Debian](https://www.debian.org/doc/) - OS/Terminal 
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-9.2.0/gcc/) - How we compiled our C programs
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/docs.php) - IDE
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) - IDE

## Discussion of Implmenetation for the Problem
The following is a brief discussion describing the implementation of the project in both Java and C, as well as comments on the amount of effort and the ease of coding the problem we had as a team programming in both Java and C.
